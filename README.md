## About me

Hello, my name is Eric Schaefer. I am a husband, father, grandfather, and software engineer living near Munich/Germany.

## What I am doing

I am developing software for all kinds of systems and tiers, always on the hunt for ways to become a better developer. I specialize in OOP with sprinkles of DDD and FP. Since the early 2000s, I am a firm proponent of Test Driven Development. When I am not developing software, I teach my fellow engineers.
